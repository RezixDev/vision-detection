# Vision Detection - How Computers see the World

I rememeber back in the Day i was impressed with some Tools like OpenCV or YOLO.

I thought that this would speed up the building of Robots or the creation of machines. Some years later, there was still no Robots walking on the streets. What a Bummer. Instead we've got GenAI Tools like ChatGPT or MidJourney. And... even better Multimodal Models. And they can also see stuff and interpret things.

But, we've got better. Let explore the new Landscape of Computer Vision and what is possible today.

Before we've got bounding boxes over a given Object. To classify one Object a lot of labelling was needed.
Today in the current landscape, with just some click's of a Mouse we are able to select what we want to focus on, and what should be ignored.
